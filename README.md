# Introduction
Hello guys, this is my project - **Lox Interpreter**. For someone who don't know what it is. Well, basically it interprets Lox - a programming language. 

My project supports almost all of basic definitions of programming language, such as variable, expression, class, function, recursion, printing... Unfortunately, I don't have much time right now so I can't add any libraries yet.

This project follows the book **Crafting Interpreters**. I suggest you read it once, and if you have time then give it a try.

# Tutorial
If you want to try my interpreter:
  * Clone this respository to your computer.
  * In folder `src/main/java` you can edit file `test.lox` or create new file if you want, let's assume this `test.lox`.
  * In the chosen file, write any Lox-code as you like.

In case you don't know any thing about Lox, here is an example:

Then, in this folder, open terminal and enter this 

```sh
java Main.java run test.lox
```
If you do it right, the terminal should print **Hello, this is DennisTran** with the example above.

**Note**: As you can see, the most important thing if you want to try is that your computer must have Java environment before. Again, in case you don't know how to install it, you can search for tutorial on Youtube. I can guide you but it will take a lot of time. And, urrghh, I'm lazy ^^.

That's it. I have showed you guys all about my project. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.
